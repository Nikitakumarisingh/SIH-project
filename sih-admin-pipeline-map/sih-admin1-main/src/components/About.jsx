        <h4> Why NRW Matters ? </h4>
        <p>Non-Revenue Water is a critical issue for water utilities worldwide. It represents water that is lost
          before it reaches consumers, due to leaks, pipe bursts, theft, or inaccuracies in billing and metering.
          Addressing NRW is not only about conserving a precious resource but also about ensuring financial
          sustainability and the delivery of safe, clean water to communities.</p>
